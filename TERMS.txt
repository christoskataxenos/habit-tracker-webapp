PULSE PROTOCOL - TERMS & PRIVACY (v1.6.0)
===========================================

1. DATA PRIVACY (THE "PULSE" PHILOSOPHY)
----------------------------------------
Pulse Protocol is built as a 100% PRIVATE and LOCAL application. 
- All your studies, focus sessions, and grades are stored exclusively on your device.
- We do not use servers to store your data.
- We do not collect analytics, emails, or usage statistics.
- No third-party trackers (Google Analytics, etc.) are present in the code.

2. CLOUD SYNC (OPTIONAL)
------------------------
The "Cloud Bridge" feature is a manual mechanism. Pulse does not automatically upload your data to any cloud service. 
- You are responsible for exporting your backup files to your own cloud storage (Dropbox, Drive, etc.).
- Pulse does not have access to your cloud credentials; the sync happens at the OS level.

3. SECURITY
-----------
- Pulse is an offline-capable tool. An internet connection is only needed for the initial bridge to your personal cloud folders.
- Since data is local, if you delete the application data without a backup, it is permanently lost. 

4. NO WARRANTY
--------------
The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind. You use it at your own risk.

5. ACCEPTANCE
-------------
By using Pulse Protocol, you acknowledge that you understand your data is your responsibility and that the application is built for privacy-first productivity.

-------------------------------------------
PULSE: Keep your rhythm alive.
